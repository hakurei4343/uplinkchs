This is not always possible though, (you may be forced to disconnect quickly) and it is not always successful.\n\nIf you can establish one link in the chain on a computer that you can access easily, you can erase the logs on that machine after every call bounce.  This requires admin access on a low security system.  Academic systems are ideal for this due to the low consequence if caught.\n\nAnother common trick is to route through a financial or government system.  These companies are typically very resistive to opening their logs to other agents, due to the sensitivity of their data. "

This is not always possible though, (you may be forced to disconnect quickly) and it is not always successful.\n\nIf you can establish one link in the chain on a computer that you can access easily, you can erase the logs on that machine after every call bounce.  This requires admin access on a low security system.

en: "One possible direction for Uplink to go is shown in the film Mission:Impossible, starring Tom Cruise when he was a much younger actor and long before his terrible accident.\n\nThis film came out in the late 20th century, but the basic idea was that a squad of real people would enter the target site (eg a bank, corporation HQ etc) and they would be assisted by a tech guy on the outside.  The tech guy would be running Uplink2, and he would be able to see the agents moving around the target site.  He would have voice control over his squad.  He would need to open doors, block elevator shafts, override building security, distract guards etc.\n\nSuccess would attract agents with better skills who could rob more advanced buildings and sites. Failure would lead to the arrest of the Agents under the guys command."

en: "Around 15 years ago a film was released in what was then called Hollywood, called Johnny Mnemonic. The film was almost universally hated, however it did contain some fantastic visulisations of the Internet of 2010.  It is frequently hilarious to see how inaccurate those predictions were.\n\nNevertheless, Uplink2 would look fantastic with a similar look. The Internet would be rendered in 3D, with major corporate computer systems appearing as huge 3D sky-scrapers.  Every tool and action would be extremely visual.\n\nIt is thought that this feel would give Uplink2 a broader appeal, but would alienate the hard-core Uplink player who values its (semi) realism. In addition, it would require a team of artists to produce the 3d models."

A number of 'core' systems would be run by Introversion Software, including most of the Government systems.

I have been working for Andromeda for the past month on a top secret project - and until yesterday I did not even know what exactly I was coding.\n\nThis story hit the news and I decided that I should try to find out what was happening with project Revelation - and yesterday I managed to gain access to their stand-alone server room and copy the files that we were working on.\n\nUnfortunately they saw what I was doing and I had to leave quick, and I haven't had time to analyse the project files yet.  If you read this then they have already caught me.\n\nARC cannot be trusted.  We must come together as a group and find out what they are up to before something terrible happens.

If you read this then they have already caught me.\n\nARC cannot be trusted.  We must come together as a group and find out what they are up to before something terrible happens.
