If you read this then they have already caught me.\nARC cannot be trusted.  We must come together as a group and find out what they are up to before something terrible happens.  I don't know if it's already too late."

As an up-and-coming Agent, you will find a number of new opportunities are now available to you.  At this point we feel we should give you an important piece of information.\n\nNow that the stakes are higher, you will certainly begin to encounter computer systems that are more secure than before.  These systems can be difficult to attack.\n\nMost of our Agents now use the HUD-Connection-Analyser to get around these systems.  This item of software was designed by Uplink Corporation specifically for bypassing security systems, and can be purchased from Uplink Internal Services.  It is designed to be used in conjunction with Security-Bypassers, also available from that site.\n\nUplink Corporation wishes you luck."

en: "The first step in establishing a secure untracable connection is to route your connection through multiple servers all over the world.  In order to trace you, the agents on the target machine will be forced to trace each link individually, which takes time.  They will get you eventually, but it will take much longer and you will have warning before they finally get back to you.  \n\nCall bouncing can be set up from the main map screen - simply click on each location to route the call through, clicking finally on the target as the final node in the chain.  Then click on the connect button to establish the connection."
cn: "建立一个无法被追踪的安全连接的第一步就是将你的连接路由全世界的多个服务器。为了追踪你，目标服务器上的特工不得不一步一步的追踪每个连接，这会耗费他们的时间。当然最终他们会追踪到你，但那所需要的时间长的多，你也会在他们最终抓住你之前收到警告。\n\n呼叫跳跃可以在主地图屏幕上设置 - 简单的点击不同的服务器来路由你的连接，最后点击目标服务器来作为这个链路的最终节点。然后点击连接按钮来建立连接。"

en: "Help/Secure Connections/Active traces"
cn: "Help/Secure Connections/Active traces"

en: "Whenever you begin to act suspiciously, the target machine will begin to trace you.  Many computers are running security software which begins a trace on certain key actions - such as trying hundreds of passwords very fast (eg a Dictionary Hacker), deleting logs or use of the admin account.  \n\nWhilst you are connected you will be traced with an Active Trace - the agents on the target machine trace the physical lines that you are using.  This method can result in a trace back to your Gateway in as little as one minute.  You can see an active trace as it happens on your mini-map, which should provide ample warning before the trace completes.  You are strongly advised to disconnect before an active trace is completed."
cn: "每当你开始进行可疑的行动时，目标服务器就会开始追踪你。许多电脑都运行安全软件，会在探测到特殊行为时开始追踪。这些特殊行为包括快速试探密码（比如使用Dictionary Hacker），删除日志或者使用管理员帐户等等。\n\n当你连接上时，就会有一个主动追踪开始追踪你 - 目标服务器上的黑客通过你所使用的物理连接来进行反向追踪。这种方法可以在短短一分钟内反向追踪到你的gateway。你可以在你的迷你地图上看见这个主动追踪的进展情况，这样能在这个追踪完成之前提供给你足够的警告。我们强烈建议你在这个主动追踪完成之前断开连接。"

en: "Help/Secure Connections/Passive traces"
cn: "Help/Secure Connections/Passive traces"

en: "Whenever you use call bouncing to connect to a computer, you will leave logs behind on each computer used.  Normally this is not a problem, but this information can be used against you.  If you disconnect before an active trace has completed, the company that owned that computer may begin a Passive Trace. \n\nThey will dig up any logs left by you and trace you that way.  It can take longer - usually several hours, but the results can be just as severe.  Because of this, you should make every effort to delete the logs you leave.\n\nYou never need to delete all the logs on every system you bounce through.  Deleting the logs on one system will be sufficient to break the chain and prevent traces from proceding."
cn: "每当你使用跳跃连接来连接一部电脑的时候，你就会在你使用过的每部电脑上留下日志信息。通常情况下这不是个问题，但这种信息也可能对你不利。如果你在一个主动追踪完成之前断开连接，拥有目标电脑的公司就会展开一个被动追踪。\n\n他们会找出你留下的所有日志信息，并通过这种方法来追踪你。这种方法为时更长 - 通常要花几个小时，但是所造成的结果一样严重。基于此，你应该在你离开之前删除掉你留下的日志信息。\n\n你并不需要在你路由经过的每个系统上删除这些日志信息，只需要在其中一个系统上删除日志，这就足以打断整个链路，使得追踪无法继续。。"

cn: "Help/Secure Connections/Trace tracking"

en: "Whilst you are hacking, it is inevitable that people will attempt to trace you.  It is very important that you avoid being traced - this of course requires that you know how close you are to being traced at any point.\n\nIf you purchase the relevent HUD upgrade (from the software sales screen), the mini-map will show you the progress of any Active Traces visually.  You can also purchase software such as the Trace Tracker which will sit in the corner of your screen and will report on the progress of any active traces.  Some later versions even report the time you have remaining before you are traced. "
cn: "每当你开始你的黑客工作时，一个针对你的追踪将不可避免的产生。躲避追踪至关重要 - 毫无疑问你应该知道追踪的进展情况。\n\n如果你购买了HUD升级（可以在软件购买选单中购买），迷你地图上便会显示所有主动追踪的进展情况。你也可以购买Trace Tracker这样的软件，它会显示在你屏幕的一角，向你报告任何主动追踪的进展。最新的版本还可以报告追踪完成的剩余时间。"

en: "Help/Secure Connections/Passive Tips"
cn: "Help/Secure Connections/Passive Tips"

en: "There are several methods of preventing Passive traces from coming back to you.  Here are some suggestions. \nFirst, it is best to delete any logs left behind on the target machine.  This is not always possible though, (you may be forced to disconnect quickly) and it is not always successful.\n\nIf you can establish one link in the chain on a computer that you can access easily, you can erase the logs on that machine after every call bounce.  This requires admin access on a low security system.  Academic systems are ideal for this due to the low consequence if caught.\n\nAnother common trick is to route through a financial or government system.  These companies are typically very resistive to opening their logs to other agents, due to the sensitivity of their data. "
cn: "有多种方法可以避免被动追踪抓住你。这里是一些建议。\n第一，最好删除你在目标机器上留下的任何日志信息。这一点有时无法办到（有时你被迫尽快断开连接）而且也不是总能成功。\n\n如果你能在链路中路由一台你很容易侵入的计算机，你就可以在每个呼叫跳跃完成后删除这台电脑上的日志信息。 这需要一个低安全性系统上的管理员权限。学校的电脑系统很适于这个用途，因为即使被抓住了后果也不会很严重。\n\n另一个广泛使用的技巧就是路由一个金融或者政府系统。出于他们信息的敏感性，这些部门通常不会向其他的黑客公开他们的日志。"

en: "When an Uplink agent logs on to his local machine, the Uplink software on his computer establishes a direct connection to his Gateway computer and runs the Uplink Operating System on that Gateway.  This allows each agent to retain a safe distance from his jumping off point onto the Web.  This gives Uplink Agents virtual anonymity in the world - there is no way to trace an agent from a Gateway.\n\nA gateway also provides the processor power, storage and high bandwidth connection necessary for an Uplink agent to complete his tasks.\nGateway computers are rented to Uplink Agents as part of the contract and are stored in secure server rooms around the world."
cn: "每当一个Uplink黑客在他自己的机器上登录时，他电脑上运行的Uplink软件将会直接建立连接到他的Gateway电脑，并在Gateway上运行Uplink操作系统。这一点使得每个黑客都能保证从他的网络接入点到外部网络有一个安全距离。这为Uplink黑客提供了一定的网络匿名性 - 无法从Gateway追踪一个黑客。\n\nGateway 也提供了高性能处理器、存储空间和宽带连接，来帮助Uplink黑客完成他们的任务。\nGateway电脑存放在遍布世界各地的安全服务器房间内，作为合同的一部分租借给Uplink黑客。"

en: "A gateway computer gives total physical anonymity to all Uplink Agents who use them.  A gateway computer is programmed to automatically disconnect any connection that has been traced back to the Gateway, thus ensuring that an agents physical location can never be determined.  Gateway computers keep no logs of access.  Further more, there is no record of which real person uses which username.  This means that, in a worse case scenario when a connection is traced back to a Gateway, any federal agents inspecting the Gateway will be able to determine the username but not the real person who uses that username.\nUnfortunately, when this happens it is often necessary for Uplink Corporation to disavow the agent in question, in order to avoid any legal consequences.  That user's account and rating will be deleted, and his gateway will be given to another agent."
cn: "gateway电脑为所有使用它们的Uplink黑客提供完全的物理匿名性。每部gateway电脑都被设定为当一个反向追踪到达时自动断开所有连接，这样便保证所有黑客的物理地址决不会被泄漏。Gateway电脑不保存任何接入日志。此外，也没有任何有关真实姓名和网络用户名的对应关系的记录，这一点保证即使在最坏的情况下，连接被反向追踪到Gateway电脑，联邦特工也只能找到黑客使用的用户名，而无法找到使用这个用户名的人。\n不幸的是，如果这样的事情发生了，Uplink公司为了避免任何法律后果，将否认与该黑客有任何关系。这个黑客的帐户和等级将会被删除，他的gateway将交给另外一个黑客使用。"

en: "Uplink Corporation owns several large offices around the world, which are used to house hundreds of Gateway computers.  These computers are openly connected to the phone network, allowing Agents to connect to them from any local computer.  The buildings are under 24 hour guard.  Engineering teams from Uplink Corporation routinely service the computers inside, installing new hardware when requested.\n\nAs such, the physical specifications of each machine can vary drastically.  With enough money, an Uplink Agent could upgrade his Gateway to enormous power.  Typically a Gateway contains an inbound modem (to allow the agent to dial in), a high speed processor and large quantities of memory storage, and a high speed broadband connection to the Net."
cn: "Uplink公司在世界各地拥有多个大规模办公中心，容纳数以百计的Gateway电脑。这些电脑与电话网洛连接，使得黑客可以在任何本地计算机上与其连接。这些办公中心拥有24小时警卫，Uplink公司派遣的工程师维护小组对所有的Gateway电脑进行定期维护，并在需要时安装新的硬件。\n\n所以，不同的电脑的配置通常千差万别。只要有足够的钱，一个Uplink黑客可以将他的Gateway升级到恐怖的性能。 通常一部Gateway包含一个内置调制解调器（允许黑客拨号连接），一个高速处理器和大量的内存存储空间，以及一个接入外部网络的高速宽带连接。"

All hardware will be installed within 24 hours by a certified Uplink technician.  Available upgrades include faster processors, more memory capacity, higher speed connections to the Net, and many more.\n\nYou can also add extra security to your Gateway by buying security camera's, laser trip wires etc, which will inform you if your Gateway is about to be seized by Federal Agents.  This can give you warning, allowing you to destroy any incriminating evidence.  You can even fit your Gateway to self-destruct on your command.  In this case, Federal Agents have no way of finding out who was using the Gateway - allowing you to keep your username and established reputation.  "
cn: "你可以从Uplink服务中心的硬件设备列表中选择新硬件来为你的Gateway升级。所有的硬件都将在24小时内由经认证的Uplink技术人员安装好。可选的升级包括更快的处理器，更大的内存容量，更高速的网络连接等等。\n\n你也可以为你的Gateway购买额外的安全部件，比如安全摄像机，光纤探测器等等。它们会在你的Gateway被联邦特工找到以前发出警告，来为你销毁犯罪证据提供宝贵的时间。你甚至可以为你的Gateway安装自毁部件，接收到你的命令就会自爆。这样，联邦特工就没办法找出谁在使用这部Gateway - 你就可以保留你的用户名和声望。"

Locate the logs that you have created from your actions (especially the ones that detail where your connection came from) and target your log deleter on them.  The logs will be deleted but will leave a clear marker behind.  More advanced versions of the log deleter can cover your tracks better, but this will be sufficient for now.\n\nIn the real world of hacking, you would probably not delete the logs on the target machine - you would not have time.  Instead, you would bounce your connection through a system on which you have admin access.  After the hack, you would connect to that system and remove those logs in safety - breaking the chain of logs between yourself and the target."

If done correctly, you can give yourself the extra few seconds need to get the job done without being caught.\n\nFirstly, bouncing through a random computer will not work against any reasonably secure system. They will be able to trace through that link in seconds.\nIf you bounce through a system that you have already compromised, and have an access account available, the trace will take much longer.\nIf you bounce through a system on which you have Admin access, the trace will take longer still.\nIn general, the higher security the system you bounce through, the longer it will take to trace through that link.\n\nIt is worth keeping in mind that you can lose your username and password login on a system if you route through it too many times."

When that person logs in, he reproduces a certain phrase or set of words.  These are then analysed and compared.\n\nRecent advances in this area have made it very difficult to crack.  For many years Digital Approximation software was capable of defeating these systems, but this is no longer the case.

en: "One possible direction for Uplink to go is shown in the film Mission:Impossible, starring Tom Cruise when he was a much younger actor and long before his terrible accident.\n\nThis film came out in the late 20th century, but the basic idea was that a squad of real people would enter the target site (eg a bank, corporation HQ etc) and they would be assisted by a tech guy on the outside.  The tech guy would be running Uplink2, and he would be able to see the agents moving around the target site.  He would have voice control over his squad.  He would need to open doors, block elevator shafts, override building security, distract guards etc.\n\nSuccess would attract agents with better skills who could rob more advanced buildings and sites. Failure would lead to the arrest of the Agents under the guys command."
cn: "Uplink的一个可能的发展方向就像汤姆・克鲁斯的电影碟中谍里的那样。\n\n这部电影是20世纪末放映的，其中一段情节体现了这样的基本理念：一组人在一个身处外部的电脑黑客的协助下侵入目标建筑（银行，公司总部之类）。那个黑客使用的就是Uplink2，他能够清楚的看见目标建筑中巡逻的保安人员。他通过声讯指挥侵入小组，他需要为小组开门，停止电梯运行，控制安全系统，调开守卫注意等等。\n\n成功的话小组就能完全不被人发现的完成任务，而失败则会导致所有人被逮捕。"

en: "Around 15 years ago a film was released in what was then called Hollywood, called Johnny Mnemonic. The film was almost universally hated, however it did contain some fantastic visulisations of the Internet of 2010.  It is frequently hilarious to see how inaccurate those predictions were.\n\nNevertheless, Uplink2 would look fantastic with a similar look. The Internet would be rendered in 3D, with major corporate computer systems appearing as huge 3D sky-scrapers.  Every tool and action would be extremely visual.\n\nIt is thought that this feel would give Uplink2 a broader appeal, but would alienate the hard-core Uplink player who values its (semi) realism. In addition, it would require a team of artists to produce the 3d models."
cn: "大约15年前好莱坞有部叫做Johnny Mnemonic的电影上映。基本上这片子拍的很烂，今天看起来其中许多不靠谱的预测看起来也很可笑，但它的确包含了一些关于2010年的互联网的相当漂亮的视觉创意，\n\n我们想Uplink2也应该有一个够炫的外表。因特网可以以3D的形式呈现，那些庞大的电脑系统看起来就像是高耸入云的3D摩天楼。所有的软件和行动都将可视化。\n\n这样的Uplink2也许会得到更多的受众，但也可能招致那些看重Uplink现实性的死忠的不满。此外也需要一组艺术家来设计这些互联网中的3D模型。"

en: "The founder of Introversion Software believes the definitive version of Uplink could only be achieved as an online massively-muliplayer universe.  When a player launches Uplink2, it would connect to a global network of Uplink2 clients.  Each agent would be able to attack other Agent computer systems and steal things from them.  A number of 'core' systems would be run by Introversion Software, including most of the Government systems.  Agents would need to work in teams to properly hack the well guarded systems.\n\nAgents would also need to defend their own systems from hackers.  In effect, it would be similar in design to Napster - everyone can see everyone else on the Uplink Network.\n\nIt is not clear what the legal situation would be - could anyone actually be prosecuted under this system?"
cn: "Introversion Software的建立者相信Uplink的最终形态将是一个多人在线游戏。当一个玩家运行 Uplink2时，它将连接到一个由Uplink2用户组成的庞大网络。每个黑客都可以攻击其他黑客的电脑，偷取感兴趣的信息。 Introversion Software将运行一些核心系统，包括许多政府系统。黑客们需要组成团队分工合作来侵入这些防守严密的系统。\n\n黑客们也要注意防御他们自己的电脑不被其他黑客攻破。总体上，这就像是Napster的设计 - 每个人都可以看见Uplink网络上的其他人。\n\n问题是怎样不超出法律限定的范畴 - 会不会有人真的因为在这个系统下干的事情而被起诉？"

This ingenious system has stopped all previous attempts at access.\n\n'We now know that somebody inside our company betrayed us' stated ARCs public relations officer in a press release this morning. 'We have found equipment which suggests somebody temporarily connected the file server to the outside world with a remote link, which left the file server open to access for a few minutes.  They must have been working with somebody on the outside to pull this off.'"

en: "Earlier today a hacker penetrated the Local Area Network of Darwin Research Associates and stole Gigaquads of data on their latest project - Darwin Digital Life.  It is not known exactly what the hackers wanted the data for, since its use is described as purely theoretical.\n\n'The idea behind Darwin Digital Life was to create a life form that could live and reproduce on the Internet' said the CEO of Darwin Research Associates recently.  'Obviously we are gutted that somebody has stolen what amounts to years of research into this area.'\n\nA suspect has been named to Federal Agents, but so far no arrests have been made.  Darwin Research Associates earlier today stated that an Uplink Agent was responsible, and that the Agent in question was working for Andromeda Research Corporation (ARC) at the time.\n\nOnce again, ARC was unwilling to comment on the issue, but this latest allegation has fueled speculation as to the ultimate motives of the company."

However, what is not commonly known is that the critial data (ie the research files themselves) are actually stored on a Stand-Alone file server, which is physically disconnected from the rest of the Internet.  When the file server is connected for use, the ARC LAN itself is disconnected, meaning their data is always totally isolated from public access.  This has made it impossible for us to steal their research until now.\n\nA member of ARCs team who wishes to remain anonymous has come forward and offered to help us. You will need to break in to the system first.  Once inside, you should be able to find the restricted file area.  Our man on the inside will then install a remote radio modem on the file server, which will give you access.  You can then copy the files.\n\nOnce done, decrypt the files and dump them onto our File Server - details below.\n\nYou may also have noticed that the CEO of ARC was recently arrested and questioned by Federal Agents in connection with Revelation.
